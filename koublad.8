.TH KOUBLAD 8
.SH NAME
koublad \- daemon that monitors another node's availability and can perform failover actions when needed.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B koublad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B koublad
is a small daemon which runs on two different servers (nodes) to handle high availability on a master/slave cluster, and performs failover actions if needed.
.PP
Each instance monitors the other node's availability via UDP pings (heartbeats) and the slave node can do a series of action to become master when the other node becomes unreachable if certain conditions are true (ex: an external host is reachable by ping, simulating a quorum mechanism in larger clusters).
